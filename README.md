## Appendix

This is certainly not my best work work, but during the time I was working on this project I felt really comfortable working with react and the next.js framework, they are both really easy to learn and fun to work with. I am looking forward to studying these more

## Lessons Learned

It becomes much more easier refering to objects and or contents of your app when you open separate folders for because if you work with multiple pages you might end up duplicating code but to create an instance is much more convenient because you can just call the object whenever you need to use it.
